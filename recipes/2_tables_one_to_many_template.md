# Two Tables Design Recipe Template

_Copy this recipe template to design and create two related database tables from a specification._

## 1. Extract nouns from the user stories or specification

```
STRAIGHT UP

As a Maker
So that I can let people know what I am doing  
I want to post a message (peep) to chitter

As a maker
So that I can see what others are saying  
I want to see all peeps in reverse chronological order

As a Maker
So that I can better appreciate the context of a peep
I want to see the time at which it was made

As a Maker
So that I can post messages on Chitter as me
I want to sign up for Chitter

HARDER

As a Maker
So that only I can post messages on Chitter as me
I want to log in to Chitter

As a Maker
So that I can avoid others posting messages on Chitter as me
I want to log out of Chitter

```

```

```

## 2. Infer the Table Name and Columns

Put the different nouns in this table. Replace the example with your own nouns.

| Record                | Properties                     |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------|
| peeps                 | title, content, time, maker_id
| makers                | name, email, username, password

1. Name of the first table (always plural): `makers` 

    Column names: `name`, `email`, `username`, `password`

2. Name of the second table (always plural): `peeps` 

    Column names: `title`, `content`, `time`, `maker_id`

## 3. Decide the column types.

[Here's a full documentation of PostgreSQL data types](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype.html).

Most of the time, you'll need either `text`, `int`, `bigint`, `numeric`, or `boolean`. If you're in doubt, do some research or ask your peers.

Remember to **always** have the primary key `id` as a first column. Its type will always be `SERIAL`.

```
# EXAMPLE:

Table: makers
id: SERIAL
title: text
email: text
username: text
password: text

Table: peeps
id: SERIAL
title: text
content: text
time: timestamp
maker_id: int
```

## 4. Decide on The Tables Relationship

Most of the time, you'll be using a **one-to-many** relationship, and will need a **foreign key** on one of the two tables.

To decide on which one, answer these two questions:

1. Can one [TABLE ONE] have many [TABLE TWO]? (Yes)
2. Can one [TABLE TWO] have many [TABLE ONE]? (No)

You'll then be able to say that:

1. **[A] has many [B]**
2. And on the other side, **[B] belongs to [A]**
3. In that case, the foreign key is in the table [B]

Replace the relevant bits in this example with your own:

```
# EXAMPLE

1. Can one maker have many peeps? YES
2. Can one peep have many makers? NO

-> Therefore,
-> A maker HAS MANY peeps
-> A peep BELONGS TO a maker

-> Therefore, the foreign key is on the peeps table.
```

*If you can answer YES to the two questions, you'll probably have to implement a Many-to-Many relationship, which is more complex and needs a third table (called a join table).*

## 4. Write the SQL.

```sql
-- EXAMPLE
-- file: albums_table.sql

-- Replace the table name, columm names and types.

-- Create the table without the foreign key first.
CREATE TABLE makers (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name text,
  email text,
  username text,
  password text
);

-- Then the table with the foreign key first.
CREATE TABLE peeps (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  title text,
  content text,
  time timestamp,
-- The foreign key name is always {other_table_singular}_id
  maker_id int,
  constraint fk_maker foreign key(maker_id)
    references makers(id)
    on delete cascade
);



```

## 5. Create the tables.

```bash
# psql -h 127.0.0.1 database_name < albums_table.sql
```
